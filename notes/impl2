Storage, only storing events / diffs / bits,
    because the state is mutable (balances can change), but the events / bits / transaction cannot and the immutability solves a wide range of problems

10:36 -> who should be "transactionFrom"? -> just use some random numbers

questions:
- is every message broadcasted?
- also: how do I know that the node has received all sync messages?
    - just count them? xD

- for the future => maybe just give people protobufs? xD
- ask if we can replace it :D
- can we do an integration test? :D
